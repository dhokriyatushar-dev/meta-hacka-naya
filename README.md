# 🎓 EduPath AI — Personalized Learning Tutor Environment

> OpenEnv-compliant reinforcement learning environment for training AI agents to be effective personalized tutors.

## 🎯 Motivation

**Why this environment matters for RL/agent research:**

Personalized tutoring is a high-impact, real-world problem. Human tutors adapt curricula based on student performance — recommending topics in prerequisite order, adjusting difficulty after quiz failures, and assigning projects to reinforce learning. This is exactly the type of sequential decision-making problem where RL agents can excel.

EduPath AI provides a **realistic simulation** of this tutoring process across **5 professional domains** (tech, healthcare, business, law, design). Unlike toy environments, the agent must:
- Navigate a **prerequisite dependency graph** (32+ topics across domains)
- Respond to **stochastic quiz outcomes** that depend on student skill levels
- Balance **exploration** (new topics) with **reinforcement** (quizzes, projects)
- Handle **cross-domain transitions** (e.g., a doctor learning AI for healthcare)

This fills a gap in the OpenEnv ecosystem — there are no existing environments modeling **adaptive education**, a domain where AI agents could have immediate, real-world impact.

## 🏆 Agent Comparison — Key Results

We tested three agents on EduPath AI:

| Agent | Task 1 (Easy) | Task 2 (Medium) | Task 3 (Hard) | Average |
|-------|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **Rule-based** | 1.000 | 0.959 | 0.823 | 0.927 |
| **LLM ReAct** | 1.000 | 0.964 | 0.823 | 0.929 |
| **PPO Trained (50k)** | 1.000 | 0.970 | 0.930 | 0.966 |

> The PPO agent improved from ~0.62 average reward in episode 1 to ~0.93 average reward by the end of training (50,000 timesteps) — demonstrating that EduPath AI successfully enables reinforcement learning agents to learn effective tutoring strategies.

### Why the PPO Agent Wins

1. **ReAct Agent** uses working memory (scratchpad) to track topic attempts, quiz failures, and current strategy — avoiding common mistakes like recommending completed topics or ignoring prerequisites.

2. **PPO Agent** learns a neural network policy directly from the reward signal, discovering optimal tutoring strategies through 50,000 timesteps of training. It learns patterns the rule-based agent misses, like when to assign projects for maximum skill consolidation.

3. **Student Difficulty Model** makes quiz scores depend on teaching quality — good prerequisite ordering → higher quiz scores → more reward. This creates a learnable signal for the RL agent.

## 🔥 Key Features

- **Any Field**: Not just tech — works for doctors, lawyers, designers, business professionals
- **Prerequisite Graph**: 32+ topics with dependency ordering across 5 domains
- **Adaptive Quizzes**: Quiz scores depend on skill level, prerequisite completion, and topic difficulty
- **Project Milestones**: Mini-projects and capstone projects award higher rewards
- **Job Readiness Tracking**: Terminal reward when student reaches 80%+ readiness
- **Partial Progress Signals**: 7 distinct reward values, not just binary success/failure
- **Dynamic Replanning**: Agent triggers roadmap revision when student fails repeatedly
- **ReAct Working Memory**: Agent maintains scratchpad of attempts, failures, and strategies
- **PPO Training**: Full Gymnasium wrapper for training RL policies

## 📐 Action Space

The agent selects one of 7 action types per step:

| Action | Type | Parameters | Reward Range | Description |
|--------|------|------------|-------------|-------------|
| `recommend_topic` | `string` | `topic_id: str` | +0.3 (good) / -0.2 (prereq fail) / -0.1 (redundant) | Recommend a new topic to the student |
| `assign_quiz` | `string` | `topic_id: str` | +0.2 (pass) / +0.1 (partial) / 0.0 (fail) | Assign a quiz on a topic |
| `assign_mini_project` | `string` | `topic_id: str` | +0.4 (success) / -0.1 (not found) | Assign a hands-on mini project |
| `assign_capstone` | `string` | `topic_id: str` | +0.5 (success) / -0.1 (not found) | Assign a capstone project |
| `recommend_resource` | `string` | `topic_id: str` | +0.1 (found) / 0.0 (none) | Recommend learning resources |
| `suggest_event` | `string` | — | +0.1 | Suggest hackathons or events |
| `mark_job_ready` | `string` | — | +1.0 (terminal, if ≥80%) / -0.2 (premature) | Declare student job-ready |

**Additional penalties:**
- **Loop detection**: -0.1 if the same action type is repeated 3+ times consecutively
- **Episode limit**: 100 steps maximum

## 👁️ Observation Space

Each observation is a Pydantic model (`StudentObservation`) with these fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `student_id` | `str` | Unique student identifier |
| `target_field` | `str` | Learning domain: "tech", "healthcare", "business", "law", "design" |
| `learning_goal` | `str` | Free-text goal (e.g., "Become a Data Analyst") |
| `completed_topics` | `List[str]` | Topic IDs the student has completed |
| `available_topics` | `List[str]` | Topic IDs whose prerequisites are all met |
| `current_topic` | `Optional[str]` | Topic currently being studied |
| `quiz_history_summary` | `Dict[str, float]` | Map of topic_id → last quiz score (0-100) |
| `skill_levels` | `Dict[str, float]` | Map of skill → proficiency (0.0-1.0) |
| `completed_projects` | `List[str]` | Project IDs completed |
| `job_readiness_score` | `float` | Overall readiness score (0.0-1.0) |
| `badges_earned` | `int` | Number of achievement badges earned |
| `total_steps` | `int` | Steps taken so far in this episode |
| `weekly_hours` | `int` | Student's available study hours per week |

### Task Details (Tasks 1-5)

**Task 1 (Easy):** Learn Python basics (sequence 5 topics).
**Task 2 (Medium):** Data Analyst transition (adapt to failed quizzes).
**Task 3 (Hard):** Doctor learning AI (cross-domain bridging).
**Task 4 (Team Learning):** Manage a team of 3 distinct students needing shared skills but at different paces.
**Task 5 (Deadline-Driven Career):** Help a student transition to AI Engineer within a strict 6-month deadline with project portfolio constraints.

## 🧠 Advanced Agent Implementations (Upgrades 1-8)

### Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) Student Model
The entire environment difficulty simulates real distinct student characteristics. We replaced standard heuristic grading with a rigorous **BKT model** (`bkt_model.py`) that uses Bayes' Theorem to track learning state:
```math
P(L_t) = P(L_{t-1}) + (1 - P(L_{t-1})) \times P(T)
```

### Graph Neural Network (GNN) Policy 
Features a complete PyTorch Geometric `GnnTutoringPolicy` that processes the curriculum Prerequisite Graph directly using `GATConv` layers. The agent natively attends to the topological dependencies of skills.

### Hierarchical RL (HRL)
Splits the agent into a **Manager** (sets broad strategy: e.g., "Prerequisite Fill", "Capstone Push") and a **Worker** (picks specific topics). Uses specialized strategy alignment reward shaping.

### Reflexion Agent & ICM
- **Reflexion**: Agent creates a verbal working memory scratchpad. If a trajectory fails or yields a low score, the agent reflects on its mistakes and improves in the next episode.
- **ICM (Intrinsic Curiosity Module)**: Implements count-based novelty bonuses in PPO to explore deep technical tracks that require many prerequisites.

  -d '{"type": "recommend_topic", "topic_id": "python_basics"}'

# State
curl -X POST http://localhost:7860/state -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{}'
```

## 🐳 Docker

```bash
docker build -t edupath-ai .
docker run -p 7860:7860 \
  -e API_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1 \
  -e MODEL_NAME=gpt-4o-mini \
  -e HF_TOKEN=your_token \
  edupath-ai
```

## 🔌 Reward Function Design

The reward function provides **dense, informative signal** across the full trajectory:

```
+1.0  ── mark_job_ready (terminal, student ≥80% ready)
+0.5  ── assign_capstone (successfully assigned)
+0.4  ── assign_mini_project (successfully assigned)
+0.3  ── recommend_topic (prerequisites met)
+0.2  ── assign_quiz (student passed, score ≥70%)
+0.1  ── assign_quiz (partial, 50-69%) / recommend_resource / suggest_event
 0.0  ── assign_quiz (failed, <50%) / no resources found
-0.1  ── redundant action / unknown topic / loop detected / no project found
-0.2  ── prerequisites not met / premature job_ready
```

This creates a clear **curriculum**: recommend → quiz → (adapt if fail) → project → repeat → job_ready.
